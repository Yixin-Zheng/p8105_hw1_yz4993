# Problem 1

The `penguins` dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns. The dataset
contains the following variables:

- species is a factor denoting the penguins’ species: Adelie, Gentoo,
  Chinstrap.

- island is a factor denoting the islands where penguins were found:
  Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream.

- bill_length_mm is a number denoting the bill length of penguin in
  millimeters, with a range from 32.1 mm to 59.6 mm.

- bill_depth_mm is a number denoting the bill depth of penguin in
  millimeters, with a range from 13.1 mm to 21.5 mm.

- flipper_length_mm is an integer denoting the flipper length of penguin
  in millimeters, with a range from 172 mm to 231 mm.

- body_mass_g is an integer denoting the body mass of penguin in grams,
  with a range from 2700 g to 6300 g.

- sex is a factor denoting the penguins sex: male, female, NA.

- year is an integer denoting the study year: 2007, 2008, 2009.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

``` r
#Suppressed warning and message outputs related to missing values and image saving (by changing options of code chunk)
#create a scatter plot with bill_length_mm on the x-axis and flipper_length_mm on the y-axis, color points based on species
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
#add points to plot
  geom_point() + 
#add labels and title and legend to the plot
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length",
    x = "Bill Length (mm)",
    y = "Flipper Length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin Species"
  )
